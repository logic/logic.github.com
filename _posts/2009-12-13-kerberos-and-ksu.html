<p>Kerberos as a site-wide authentication mechanism has it's benefits, but the software that's typically used to drive it is getting a little long in the tooth. ksu, the kerberized equivalent to su, is only a partial implementation of what su does; there's no argument to ksu that says "this is a login shell, please set up the necessary environment". Even su has a couple of failings; in particular, if you're an X user, you're probably familiar with how su - doesn't bring your X authentication data along for the ride.</p>

<p>So, I fixed both of those a while back, with a really ugly shell script. Just in case anyone else might find it handy, here it is:</p>
